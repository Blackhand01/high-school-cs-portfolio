# high-school-cs-portfolio
A curated collection of my high school computer science projects and exercises.
This repository is organized by topic and focuses on small, self-contained examples.

## Contents
- **C Basics**: fundamentals, pointers, file I/O
- **Java OOP**: classes, inheritance, small console apps
- **Embedded/Arduino**: sensor logging and serial communication (if applicable)

## How to run
Each folder under `projects/` contains its own README with build/run instructions.

## Notes
- This is a historical snapshot of my early work.
- I kept the code mostly as-is, but added documentation and minimal cleanup where needed.

## License
MIT (see `LICENSE`).
