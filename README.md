## 🔄 Repository Organization

This repository was recently reorganized following best practices:
- **Naming**: All files use English, lowercase with hyphens
- **Structure**: Hierarchical organization by topic and skill level
- **Discoverability**: Clear folder names and README files in each section
- **Scalability**: Structured to accommodate future projects

See [refactor.md](refactor.md) for complete reorganization details and migration guide.
